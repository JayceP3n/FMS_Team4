| GOAL  | RESULT |
| :---: | :---   |
| Change the buttons and title to match the theme  | _W.I.P._
| Organisation of files... maybe  | _W.I.P._
| Add background music/sound  | _W.I.P._
| Add features  | *(If requested)*
| Find alternatives for the back/home button, instead of changing backgrounds, show/hide butons  | _Tried using [document.referrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer) and [history.go()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/go), however there are issues regarding on the access authorization to a certain link when a button is clicked. If it were to avoid it, it will eventually make the **whole** site blocked due to third party interferance._
