| GOAL  | RESULT |
| :---: | :---   |
| Change the buttons and title to match the theme  | _FINISHED_
| Add background music/sound  | _FINISHED_
| Add features  | *(If requested)*
| Find alternatives for the back/home button, instead of changing backgrounds, show/hide butons  | _Tried using [document.referrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer) and [history.go()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/go), however there are issues regarding on the access authorization to a certain link when a button is clicked. If it were to avoid it, it will eventually make the **whole** site blocked due to third party interferance._ 

## UPDATES
Referring to the goal `"Find alternatives for the back/home button, instead of changing backgrounds, show/hide butons"`, I've realized that in replit there is a feature that can run your website in a separate tab, called `New Tab` located at the top right corner of the `Webview`
